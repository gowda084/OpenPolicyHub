Governments frequently release public policies, budgets, and legislation, but these documents are often complex, difficult to interpret, and lack AI-driven insights. As a result, citizens, researchers, and activists struggle to analyze policies, track public spending, and understand the impact of government decisions on different communities.

This project aims to build an AI-powered, open-source (FOSS) platform that makes policy analysis more transparent, accessible, and insightful using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and DataÂ Visualization.
